## Data Transfer Object

Data transfer objects (DTOs) are objects that carry data between processes. DTO is a form of conversion of an object into another form that can be easily returned to its original form without losing important information about the object.

The commonly used form is JSON but it does not rule out the possibility of using other forms such as XML.
