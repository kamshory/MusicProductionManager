## MagicObject with PDO

### Overview

With the release of **MagicObject 2.7**, a significant update has been introduced to allow users to leverage **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) for database connections. In previous versions, **MagicObject** required the use of **PicoDatabase**, its custom database handling class. However, recognizing that many developers are accustomed to establishing database connections via traditional PDO, this new version introduces flexibility by allowing PDO connections to be passed directly to the **MagicObject** constructor.

This update aims to bridge the gap between traditional PDO-based database management and the advanced features provided by **MagicObject**, thus enhancing compatibility while retaining all the powerful functionality of the framework.

### Why PDO Support?

The decision to support **PDO** was made to accommodate users who have already established database connections in their applications using PDO, instead of relying on **PicoDatabase** from the start. By supporting PDO, **MagicObject** allows users to continue working with their preferred method of connecting to the database while still benefiting from the full range of features and utilities **MagicObject** offers.

While PDO is now an option for initializing **MagicObject**, it is used only in the constructor. Once the object is initialized, **MagicObject** continues to use **PicoDatabase** for all subsequent database interactions, ensuring that users can still benefit from **PicoDatabase**'s advanced features like automatic query building, database abstraction, and optimized query execution.

### How PDO Support Works

In **MagicObject 2.7**, when you pass a **PDO** connection object to the constructor, it is automatically converted into a **PicoDatabase** instance using the `PicoDatabase::fromPdo()` static method. This ensures that even though PDO is used to establish the initial connection, the object will still operate using **PicoDatabase** for all subsequent database operations. The constructor of **MagicObject** ensures that the database connection is properly initialized and the type of database is correctly detected based on the PDO driver.

### Benefits of PDO Support in MagicObject 2.7

-   **Compatibility**: This change makes **MagicObject** more compatible with existing applications that are already using PDO for database connections. Developers can continue to use PDO for initializing connections while taking advantage of **PicoDatabase**'s advanced database features for the rest of the application.
    
-   **Flexibility**: Developers now have the flexibility to choose between traditional PDO connections and **PicoDatabase**, depending on their needs. This is especially useful for applications transitioning to **MagicObject** but needing to maintain compatibility with existing database handling code.
    
-   **Ease of Transition**: By supporting PDO in the constructor, **MagicObject** makes it easier for developers to gradually adopt its features without the need to refactor existing database handling code.

### Conclusion

Version 2.7 of **MagicObject** introduces an important enhancement by allowing PDO connections to be used alongside **PicoDatabase**. This update provides greater flexibility for developers, allowing them to work with traditional PDO connections if they choose, while still benefiting from the advanced features of **MagicObject** for database interactions. This change aligns with the goal of making **MagicObject** more accessible to a wider range of developers, whether they are just starting with **MagicObject** or are looking to transition from an existing PDO-based application.
