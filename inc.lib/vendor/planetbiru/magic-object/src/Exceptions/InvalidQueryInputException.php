/**
 * Class InvalidQueryInputException
 * 
 * Thrown when there is an error with the format of annotation attributes applied to a class, property, or method.
 * 
 * This exception is triggered when annotations provided in the code do not meet the expected format or structure.
 * Common scenarios for throwing this exception include:
 * - Malformed annotation values.
 * - Missing required parameters in annotations.
 * - Incorrect application of annotations to classes, properties, or methods that do not support them.
 * 
 * Example scenarios where this exception may be used:
 * - A class is annotated with an unsupported attribute or a malformed annotation.
 * - A property is annotated with an incorrect attribute that does not conform to the expected format.
 * - A method receives an unsupported or malformed annotation, resulting in a failure during runtime or reflection processing.
 * 
 * This exception is useful for catching annotation-related errors early in the code execution, allowing developers to quickly address any misconfigurations.
